# Soil Moisture and Temperature Sensor

This repository contains code and resources for a soil moisture and temperature sensor system using Arduino. With this project, you can easily measure and monitor the moisture and temperature levels of soil in your garden, farm, or any other application that requires accurate environmental monitoring.

## Features

- **Soil Moisture Measurement:** The code provided allows you to interface Arduino with a soil moisture sensor to measure the moisture content in the soil. The sensor provides reliable readings, enabling you to make informed decisions about watering or irrigation requirements.

- **Temperature Sensing:** In addition to soil moisture measurement, this project includes the capability to measure soil temperature using a temperature sensor. You can monitor temperature fluctuations, helping you assess the optimal conditions for plant growth or other temperature-sensitive applications.

- **User-friendly Interface:** The Arduino code is written in a beginner-friendly manner, making it easy for anyone to understand and modify according to their specific needs. The code includes detailed comments and explanations to guide you through the implementation process.

- **Real-time Monitoring:** By connecting Arduino to a display module or using serial communication, you can view the real-time readings of soil moisture and temperature. This allows you to observe changes and trends over time, ensuring prompt action can be taken when necessary.

- **Alerts and Automation:** With the provided code, you can set up thresholds for soil moisture and temperature levels. When these thresholds are crossed, you can trigger alerts or automation systems to notify you or take automated actions, such as activating a water pump or adjusting environmental controls.

- **Data Logging:** The code includes functionality for logging sensor data to an SD card or transmitting it to a computer for further analysis. This enables you to collect and analyze historical data, helping you make data-driven decisions and track environmental trends.
